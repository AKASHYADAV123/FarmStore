                Foreign investment in U.S. cropland has nearly tripled in the past decade, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.

                The total cropland controlled by foreign interests in 2020 was 10.9 million acres, up from 4.1 million acres in 2010.
                
                This increase has been largely driven by foreign-owned wind companies signing long-term leases on a large number of acres, according to the USDA. However, “the acres actually utilized by said companies are very few due to the small footprint of the wind towers erected on the land,” a USDA report said.
                
                Foreign investors own more than just cropland. Overall, they own or lease nearly 37.6 million acres of agricultural land, including forests and pastures. That is an area slightly larger than the state of Illinois and makes up 2.9 percent of all privately held agricultural land in the U.S. This is up from a total of 24.2 million acres in 2010, according to the USDA.

                Under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act, all foreign holders of agricultural land—whether that is owners or long-term renters—must report those holdings to USDA.

                Those reports are filed via a FSA-153 report. Each year, the USDA releases that information in an annual report, which shows where that investment is growing. Investigate Midwest obtained a database containing all of the information behind the USDA's report. Although the USDA has released a 2020 report, the latest data available is through 2019.

                The database has significant gaps. There are more than 3.1 million acres without an owner listed. Spot checks show that many parcels listed are no longer controlled by the owner in the database. It is unclear if land is removed from the database after it is sold or a lease is terminated.

            <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;">
                While the database has significant errors and often has incomplete information, it still is a strong indicator of the quantity of land being sold or leased to foreign interests.

                This growing level of investment has sparked legislative action. Currently, three bills before Congress would require additional review of foreign investment. Also, 14 states restrict or prohibit foreign ownership of farmland, though none outright forbid it, according to a November memo by the Congressional Research Service.

                Senator Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has been one of the leading voices concerned about foreign ownership of agricultural land. As a representative, Grassley helped write AFIDA, which became law in 1978, and has introduced the bipartisan Food Security is National Security Act during multiple sessions of Congress.

                Grassley said that America’s young farmers will struggle to replace an aging farming population if farmland continues to become an investment.
